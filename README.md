# NeuerEnergy Demo
A simple Analysis-based demo of the platform

## Purpose
This project aims to provide a simple demonstration flow of the new NeuerEnergy platform based on the core analysis flow. This means that it is built around accepting data input, performing simplistic statistical analysis and providing a basic outline output.

## Implementation
This demo uses an Azure Cosmos-db backend to store data values and Material UI to render the frontend components.
